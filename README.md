# i3-wpp

i3-wpp is intended to be a wallpapper manager for the i3-wm.
Currently consists of two scripts one in bash and one in python. It takes a given folder containing wallpappers and assigns randomly one wallpapper per workspace per i3 session. The wallpappers will remain fixed on each workspace even if you change the focused workspace with a mouse click. For now the workspace name has to be the default i3 names, 1 to 10.
